# What's going on?

[Traffic fatalities are at their highest level in five years](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-traffic-fatalities-1.3386126). 

In 2015, 64 people were killed on Toronto roads, 42 of which were cyclists or pedestrians. In 2014, 51 people were killed.[^cbctotrafficfatal] In 2013, there were more traffic fatalities in Toronto (63) than there were homicides (57).[^thestartokillinsteeets]


It's been getting worse and worse [for years](http://torontoist.com/2014/01/torontos-bad-year-for-traffic-fatalities/).

# How are people killed?

Pedestrians account for 52% of all fatalities and 11% of all injuries from collisions with motor vehicles in Toronto.[^topublichealthroadtohealth]

Last year, Toronto Public Health published a report that examined [pedestrian and cycling safety](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/hl/bgrd/backgroundfile-81601.pdf). They found that **in 67% of cases, pedestrians had the right of way** when they were hit by a vehicle[^topublichealthpedcyclingsafety].

This means that "most pedestrians are hit while they are obeying the law, and paying attention to their surroundings - but a vehicle comes at them in a way they canâ€™t possibly see, predict or avoid"[^spacingbustingmyths].


# Where does this happen?

Most collisions in Toronto that occur on roadways and
involve pedestrians and cyclists occur on major and minor arterial roads. About 84% of pedestrian injuries and fatalities and 87% of cyclist injuries and fatalities occur on these roads. Across all roads, 69% were struck in an intersection, and about 22% at a midblock location[^topublichealthpedcyclingsafety].

Traffic kills people **all over the city**. See for yourself:

# What can be do about it?

Even the Toronto Sun can agree: it's time for [more bike lanes](http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/26/bike-lane-on-bloor-st-makes-sense).
