<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-traffic-fatalities-1.3386126">Traffic fatalities are at their highest level in five years</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, 64 people were killed on Toronto roads, 42 of which were cyclists or pedestrians. In 2014, 51 people were killed.<sup id="fnref:cbctotrafficfatal"><a href="#fn:cbctotrafficfatal" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In 2013, there were more traffic fatalities in Toronto (63) than there were homicides (57).<sup id="fnref:thestartokillinsteeets"><a href="#fn:thestartokillinsteeets" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It's been getting worse and worse <a href="http://torontoist.com/2014/01/torontos-bad-year-for-traffic-fatalities/">for years</a>.</p>

<h1 id="how-are-people-killed">How are people killed?</h1>

<p>Pedestrians account for 52% of all fatalities and 11% of all injuries from collisions with motor vehicles in Toronto.<sup id="fnref:topublichealthroadtohealth"><a href="#fn:topublichealthroadtohealth" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Last year, Toronto Public Health published a report that examined <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/hl/bgrd/backgroundfile-81601.pdf">pedestrian and cycling safety</a>. They found that <strong>in 67% of cases, pedestrians had the right of way</strong> when they were hit by a vehicle<sup id="fnref:topublichealthpedcyclingsafety"><a href="#fn:topublichealthpedcyclingsafety" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This means that "most pedestrians are hit while they are obeying the law, and paying attention to their surroundings - but a vehicle comes at them in a way they canâ€™t possibly see, predict or avoid"<sup id="fnref:spacingbustingmyths"><a href="#fn:spacingbustingmyths" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="where-does-this-happen">Where does this happen?</h1>

<p>Most collisions in Toronto that occur on roadways and
involve pedestrians and cyclists occur on major and minor arterial roads. About 84% of pedestrian injuries and fatalities and 87% of cyclist injuries and fatalities occur on these roads. Across all roads, 69% were struck in an intersection, and about 22% at a midblock location<sup id="fnref:topublichealthpedcyclingsafety:1"><a href="#fn:topublichealthpedcyclingsafety" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Traffic kills people <strong>all over the city</strong>. See for yourself:</p>

<p>Even the Toronto Sun can agree: it's time for <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/26/bike-lane-on-bloor-st-makes-sense">more bike lanes</a>.</p>
